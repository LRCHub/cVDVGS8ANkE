# Benny Sings – Nobody’s Fault

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Hey, it's nobody’s fault
We're getting old
And time keeps pushing on
To the end of the road
My darling
Hey, what can you say?
It's better this way
It's time to sing your song
So I'm letting you go
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's done
Wait 'til it's done,
done, done, done
No more talking
No more talking
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to run
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's gone
Wait 'til it's gone,
gone, gone, gone
No more talking
No more talking
It's all said and done
Said and done
Hey, I understand
It's not the end
This life's not what you wanted
And we all got to grow,
my darling
Hey, it's nobody's fault
We're getting old
And time keeps pushing on
To the end of the road
My darling
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's done
Wait 'til it's done,
done, done, done
No more talking
No more talking
Nowhere to run
Got nowhere to run
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's over
Wait 'til it's gone
Wait 'til it's gone,
gone, gone, gone
No more talking
No more talking
It's all said and done
Said and done
